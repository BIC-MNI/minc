New in Release 2.1.02
---------------------
* resample_volumes.c: use max <= min to set range per slice

* Added b-matrix field for Siemens diffusion scans (version >= VB
  only).
* Made changes to ordering of slices: e.g. a descending acquisition
  now has negative slice step. This was an issue with MOSAIC, in
  which the ordering of the slices in the MOSAIC image is ascending,
  even though the acquisition is descending (version >= VA25 and
  >= VB11).

* ported some HDF calls to 1.8.x
* Added libtoolize/glibtoolize logic in autogen.sh (thanks Sean)
* Fixed bug in multidim_array_is_alloced for correct check of
  memory allocation of image data. Return volume=NULL when memory
  allocation fails.

New in Release 2.0.18
---------------------
* Fixed bug with chunking for internal file compression using hdf5
  (now makes the code faster for large files)
* Smarter utilization of buffer in input_mnc.c and output_mnc.c

New in Release 2.0.17
---------------------

* 64bit bug fixes for rawtominc
* added -clobber and -verbose options to xfmconcat

New in Release 2.0.15
---------------------
* MINC2 is now built by default (or disabled with --disable-minc2).
* Began to aggregate and update all docs for a clean(er) 2.1 release
* Added cubic interpoation in mincresample for x-y slices
* Fixed a seg-fault with null history strings
* Changed all global variables to static to avoid linking problems
   with other libraries (eg: libz)
* new version of mincedit/mincheader in sh instead of csh
* Many fixes to remove compile warnings
* removed all rcsid's in files given that we have a -version argument
* Added preservation of "patient name" in nii2mnc (where patient name 
   is the descriptor field in a nifti/analyze file)
* xfmconcat now records history in the output file
* removed all fortran build bits. This code was both out of date and
   not ever built
* removed get_image_offset as with a MINC2 file this would not work
   as it was it wouldn't work that well with MINC1 let along MINC2
* changed --enable-minc2 to --disable-minc2 in configure.ac
   (come what may....)

New in Release 2.0.14

with element number 0x0010.

New in Release 2.0.11
---------------------

  scaled_maximal_pivoting_gaussian_elimination in
  volume_io/Geometry/gaussian.c and libsrc.2.

New in Release 2.0.09
---------------------
This release is primarily a bug fix release for the core MINC libraries,
as well as an opportunity to port library changes from the 1.X series.
One of the most important changes involves support for HDF5 versions
subsequent to version 1.6.2.  Previous releases of MINC 2 would not work
properly with HDF5 1.6.3 or later, but these issues should now be fixed.

Additional major changes include:

New converters added in this release:
 * minctoecat, as contributed by Anthonin Reilhac.
 * dcm2mnc

mincresample now supports "windowed sinc" interpolation. See the man
page for more details.

mincconcat now has a "-filestarts" option for greater flexibility in
combining files.  This is especially useful for concatenating functional
runs.

* mincresample now supports the sinc interpolant
* mincconcat has new -filestarts option
* Many updates and fixes to upet2mnc (Concorde microPET conversion)
* Fixes to the MINC 2.0 library (libminc2) courtesy of Leila Baghdadi
* Some progress on documentation
* Improved nii2mnc, Analyze and NIfTI-1 conversion utility
* Fix MINC 2 code to work with HDF5 1.6.4 as well as 1.6.2.  There is a
  problem with the  "make check" self-test code when using HDF5 1.6.3,
  but this problem should not affect normal operation of the code.

New in Release 2.0.08
---------------------
Several major changes are incorporated into this release.

First, the "simplified" MINC interface is now included in the
release. This interface, which is still under development, is intended
to provide easier access for software that does not need to use MINC's
more advanced features.

Second, we are beginning to include conversion programs with MINC.  For
this release, we are including converters for the new NIfTI-1 format,
created as a successor to Analyze.  FSL 3.2 and other popular fMRI
packages now support this format.  For PET users we are also including the 
ECAT to MINC format converter, with updates from Anthonin Reilhac

Third, some new tool features have been added and bugs have been fixed.
 * The mincstats bimodal threshold calculation has been fixed and
 improved.  Mincstats now supports multiple algorithms for calculating
 the bimodal threshold.  The default is still the "Otsu '97" algorithm,
 where the code for this has been corrected to give more reasonable
 results. In addition we have implemented the "Kittler & Illingworth
 '86", the "Kapur et al. '85", and a simple "mean of means" algorithms 
 as options.
* mincmakescalar now warns the user if an attempt is made to convert
a file that has a vector_dimension that is NOT the fastest-varying 
dimension in the image.  Previously the program would simply copy the
input file to the output unmodified, without warning the user.

In addition to these changes, many bugs and issues with the MINC 2.0
format and interface have been fixed. 

* Added conversion subdirectory with PRELIMINARY converters for ECAT, 
Concorde microPET, and NIfTI-1 data files.
* Simplified MINC programming interface.
* Many bug fixes
* See WHATSNEW-2.0 for additional details

New in Release 2.0.07
---------------------
* Added automatic creation of "ident" attribute in all MINC files.
* Added -sappend and -dappend arguments to minc_modify_header
* Most man pages updated
* Fixed endian-ness issues which could affect interoperability in 
  MINC 2.0 format
* Changed volume_io caching defaults

New in Release 2.0.06
---------------------
* No functional changes - this release is intended only to address compilation
  issues found with the SGI IRIX MIPSpro compiler.

New in Release 2.0.05
---------------------
This version represents several weeks of effort cleaning up the
existing code and trying to put things into better shape for a
release.  In particular, the existing test suites ("make check") now
run for both MINC 1.0 and MINC 2.0 format files.

One functional change is that the MINC 2.0 tools should now create
MINC 2.0 format files by default if all of the input files are
themselves in MINC 2.0 format.  In other words, you only have to
specify the "-2" option to force a MINC 2.0 file if one or more of
your input files are MINC 1.0 format.  The environment variable
"MINC_FORCE_V2" should force all output to MINC 2.0 even if MINC 1.0
files are present at the input.

There is additional documentation on the new "2.0" MINC programming
interface.  This is still very much a work in progress so your
feedback is very much appreciated, both as to the form and content of
these documents:

libsrc2/doc/minc_20.tex - Interface reference
libsrc2/doc/minc2_uguide.tex - Programmer's guide

This distribution will build its libraries as "libminc2.a" and
"libvolume_io2.a", rather than the previous "libminc.a" and
"libvolume_io.a".  This decission was intended to make it easier to
keep both MINC1 and MINC2 libraries installed simultaneously, but this
may prove to be unwieldy or unnecessary.  We welcome suggestions from
beta testers.

* More bugs fixed
* "make check" expanded to test MINC 2.0 format.
* "mincdump" added to the distribution.
* Almost all MINC 2.0 specific changes are now surrounded by "#ifdef MINC2"

New in Release 2.0.04
---------------------
* More bugs fixed
* mincconvert now takes a -compress and -chunk option to force the output
file to take on a desired structure.
* User's guide to MINC 2.0 library is now in doc/minc2_uguide.tex.  It's a
work in progress but it should contain some useful information.

New in Release 2.0.03
---------------------
* Actually implemented MINC_COMPRESS

* Many bugs fixed

New in Release 2.0.02
---------------------
* Several bug fixes

* Even newer error handling

New in Release 2.0.01
---------------------
* Support for HDF5 "MINC 2.0" format files.

* Revised error message handling.  Some new, unwanted messages are probably 
present.

* Tentative .mincrc and environment variable support.

* New programming interface.

New in Release 1.3
------------------
* Build fixes.


New in Release 1.2
------------------
* New tools: mincpik, minchistory.
* Rawtominc has new options -dimorder and -swap_bytes.
* Ability to easily create binary packages; see README.binary_packaging.

New in Release 1.1
------------------
* All MINC programs now ship with a man page.
* Rawtominc has new "-skip" option, to allow skipping header information.
* Mincstats option "-max_bins" renamed to "-int_max_bins", to avoid clash
  with "-max".
* Minccalc has new functions: tan, asin, acos, and atan.


************************************************************************

Wed Jan 16 08:43:28 EST 2002 *** RELEASE OF MINC 1.0

Tue Jan 15 12:55:21 EST 2002
   - Modified libsrc/Makefile to install ParseArgv man pages.

Tue Jan 15 10:40:49 EST 2002
   - Updated README to include minccalc and mincstats.

Mon Jan 14 16:26:53
   - Moved nd_loop, voxel_loop, ParseArgv and time_stamp to the libsrc
     directory for inclusion in the minc library. The header files will
     continue to be separate from minc.h

Mon Jan 14 15:02:39 EST 2002
   - Modified voxel_loop so that input buffers have a minimum size (1K 
     voxels). This prevents large output images from forcing buffers to 
     contain only one voxel when the requested memory is not large enough.

Wed Jan  9 08:58:27 EST 2002
   - Modified mincstats to only print a blank line after the histogram info
     if -quiet is not specified.

Fri Dec 14 12:12:42 EST 2001
   - Removed rcsid variables from volume_io .h files.

Mon Dec 10 09:11:58 EST 2001
   - Sped up mincstats by only doing centre-of-mass summing when it is
     needed (thanks to Andrew Janke for the suggestion).

Thu Dec  6 16:55:50 EST 2001
   - extensive modifications to mincstats to get it working properly and
     to add support for multiple volume and mask ranges.

Thu Dec  6 09:14:22 EST 2001
   - Corrected return from mivar_exists in minc library to use MI_RETURN
     so that ncopts is properly restored.

Tue Dec  4 12:24:29 EST 2001
   - No code changes, but checked in lex.c and gram.c in progs/minccalc.
     This fixes an interaction problem between make and CVS. When
     exporting the minc tree the file dates are set to the commit time. 
     If the generated .c files were previously committed at the same time
     as the generating files (.l and .y), then later makes on the exported
     files might try to rebuild the .c files. Since these file dates tend 
     to end up in the distribution, the distribution will not build cleanly
     without bison and flex being installed.

Wed Nov 28 10:36:13 EST 2001
   - Removed limit on number of icv's that can exist at one time.
     The definition of MI_MAX_NUM_ICV remains, but it is no longer
     enforced.
   - Added function set_minc_input_user_real_range to allow users
     to set the scaling for input to integers. This forces the Volume
     real range to a particular pair of values, rather than using the full 
     range of the file.
   - Added get_info_voxel_index to voxel_loop to allow users to get the
     full multi-dimensional file index of the current voxel.
   - Allow arg_string in voxel_loop to be NULL.

Tue Nov 13 16:04:36 EST 2001
   - Modified icv normalization handling in minc library. When the icv
     type is floating point, normalization is always done (scaling to real 
     values), regardless of the normalization setting. When the file type
     is floating point, rescaling of internal integers are done using 
     the slice real range (image-max/min). Thus image-max/min are only
     completely ignored for integer to integer conversion. This fixes
     some problems that appeared when converting from int to float or float 
     to int with mincrehape.

Tue Nov 13 09:17:17 EST 2001
   - Added functions miget_image_range and mivar_exists to minc_convenience.c.
   - In mincreshape, set output valid range correctly for conversion from 
     int to float types.

Wed Oct 31 14:40:30 EST 2001
   - Fixed mincinfo printing of sign for default output. Change to
     miget_datatype had messed this up.
   - Changed names of macros _R and _P in volume_io/Include/geometry.h to 
     avoid clashes with macro in ctype.h.

Wed Oct 17 14:33:00 EDT 2001
   - Modified miset_valid_range to write out valid_range as double in all
     cases except float. Unfortunately, writing out values in a type that
     matched the type of the image variable caused problems with programs
     linked against old minc libraries.

Tue Sep 18 11:47:13 EDT 2001
   - In library function miset_valid_range, changed output type of 
     valid_range from byte to short when image type is byte.

Tue Sep 18 11:34:16 EDT 2001
   - Always create image variable last in order to allow images > 2GB on
     64-bit machines (offset to variable must be < 2GB, but size can be 
     greater). This also fixes a compatibility problem between NetCDF 3.x 
     and 2.3, in which 3.x can create files that cause 2.3-linked programs
     to crash (when NC_NOFILL is set). Putting the image variable at the end
     ensures that data is always written to the end of the file, assuming 
     that the image data will always be completely written.

Mon Aug 20 09:20:04 EDT 2001
   - more fixes to valid_range handling functions
   - added function miattget_with_sign

Thu Aug 16 12:47:32 EDT 2001
   - added library functions to handle reading and writing of valid_range
     and reading of type and sign, as well as setting of default range
     values for a given type. These routines properly handle type differences
     between valid_range and the image variable. For the case of a float image
     and a double valid_range attribute, valid data can go out of range 
     and appear invalid through rounding in the conversion from double to 
     float and back. Writing of the valid_range attribute now follows the
     NetCDF convention of having the same type for variables and valid_range.
     Modified volume_io, voxel_loop and programs to use these functions.
   - modified minctoraw so that user must specify either -normalize or
     -nonormalize

Mon Aug 13 09:44:13 EDT 2001
   - Changed use of floorf to floor in macro SCALAR_ROUND of node.h in
     minccalc.
   - Added invocation of ranlib when installing minc and volume_io libraries.

************************************************************************

Fri Aug 10 08:49:54 EDT 2001 *** RELEASE OF MINC 0.8

Fri Aug 10 08:49:34 EDT 2001
   - Fixed Makefiles in doc directories so that they build properly

Tue Apr 24 14:18:07 EDT 2001
   - Added minccalc from Andrew Janke to progs directory.

Tue Apr 24 12:21:42 EDT 2001
   - Fixed bug in execute_decompress_command in libsrc/netcdf_convenience.c
     that caused multiple stdio buffer flushing when opening compressed files 
     (particularly with mincinfo).
   - Moved volume_io documentation build from doc directory to
     volume_io/Documentation, and added install-docs target to
     top-level Makefile.

Tue Apr 24 09:43:38 EDT 2001
   - Replaced NC_NAT by MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE since NC_NAT is not defined for
     NetCDF 3.1-3.4. Because NC_NAT and NC_UNSPECIFIED are defined through
     enums, they cannot be detected by the preprocessor. So we just define
     MI_ORIGINAL_TYPE to the same value ((nc_type) 0).

Mon Apr 23 09:20:36 EDT 2001
   - Fixed volume_io/Volumes/output_mnc.c to pass cdfid to mivarput* instead
     of minc_icv id (patch from Steve Robbins). Problems showed up when
     used NetCDF 3.x

Tue Apr 17 15:00:48 EDT 2001
   - Modified to build with NetCDF 3.x.
     Changed NC_LONG to NC_INT, as well as corresponding longs to ints.
     Replaced NC_UNSPECIFIED with NC_NAT (not-a-type).
     Changed volume_io to use UNSIGNED_INT instead of UNSIGNED_LONG.
     Added appropriate definitions to support both of these with both
     NetCDF 2.x and 3.x.
     Changed error handling to be independent of NetCDF library apart
     from use of ncopts and ncerr. Uses old style NetCDF2 error handling
     still, but no longer makes use of NetCDF internals.
     Removed all prototype wrappers to only support ANSI C.
     Changed fortran build - no longer generate .c from .src with m4
     since fortran support mechanism under NetCDF has changed. 
     Keeping irix5 .c file for backwards compatibility. Only build when 
     BUILD_FORTRAN is set to "yes".

Mon Apr  2 11:35:29 EDT 2001
   - Added -keep_real_range option to mincresample for resampling labels.

Fri Nov  3 11:44:38 EST 2000
   - Modified -dinsert option to minc_modify_header to allow multiple values.

Tue Sep 19 11:37:41 EDT 2000
   - Added option for user-defined allocation function to voxel_loop code
   - Added LICENSE file to top-level directory

Wed Sep 13 11:38:49 EDT 2000
   - added bzip support (patches from Steve Robbins)
   - modified TMPDIR to look in /var/tmp, /usr/tmp, /tmp in scripts
     mincdiff, mincheader, mincview and mincedit (Steve Robbins)
   - converted mincheader and mincdiff to Bourne shell (Steve Robbins)

Fri Jul  7 09:34:17 EDT 2000
   - added -filelist option to mincaverage, mincmath, mincconcat to read
     input file names from a file. This gets around command-line length
     limits.

Wed Apr 26 15:36:04 EDT 2000
   - modified mincinfo to handle multiple files (patch from Steve Robbins)

Wed Apr  5 09:02:55 EDT 2000
   - fixed bug in mincresample to properly handle valid fillvalues in slices
     containing no original data.

************************************************************************

Tue Mar 21 10:03:15 EST 2000 *** RELEASE OF MINC 0.7

Wed Feb  2 13:43:43 EST 2000
   - modified miexpand_file in library so that fclose is not called with a
     NULL fp when the file does not exist. This would cause a seg fault with
     newer versions of glibc.

Thu Jan 20 15:36:04 EST 2000
   - Re-arranged headers in volume_io so that only volume_io.h needs to be 
     on the search path. Other header files are installed in the 
     volume_io subdirectory and found by volume_io.h. 
     (Patch from Steve Robbins.)

Tue Oct 19 14:45:27 1999
   - Completed conversion from RCS to CVS

Fri Oct 15 15:25:56 EST 1999
   - Moved the Acr_nema libraries and conversion programs out of the minc
     package.

Fri Nov 13 11:02:51 EST 1998
   - Modified acrnema library to support asynchronous transfers in the
     client routines (allow sending of next message before receiving 
     reply to previous one).

Wed Nov 11 11:28:34 EST 1998
   - Modifications to acrnema library: Added functions acr_find_group and 
     acr_group_steal_element. Increased default buffer size to 64KB.

Thu Feb 19 09:06:38 EDT 1998
   - Fixes to internals of mincreshape that had not yet shown symptoms,
     but appeared with insure++.

Thu Aug 13 15:35:15 EDT 1998
   - Modified mincconcat so that the coordinate variable corresponding
     to the concatenation dimension is always created, subscripted
     with by the dimension (like an irregularly-spaced
     dimension). This is required by some programs that want all of
     the time points (in particular) to be stored even for a
     regularly-spaced dimension.

Mon Jun 22 10:06:29 EDT 1998
   - Fixed bug in rawtominc in handling of default types and signs. This
     bug showed up when options -short and -scan_range were used with data 
     containing negative values.

Wed Apr 22 16:23:06 EDT 1998
   - Fixed a bug in fortran test program minc_ftest.f in which an 
     insufficient number of arguments were being passed to miclos.

Mon Mar 23 15:17:49 EST 1998
   - Moved some functions in the acr-nema library from one file to another.

Tue Mar 17 12:05:43 EST 1998
   - Modified acrnema library so that default maximum length for client
     connections is 1MB to fix problems with servers that do not handle
     maximum length 0 (unlimited).

Tue Mar 10 12:07:28 EST 1998
   - Fixed more bugs in acrnema library to prevent core dumps under Linux 
     when a protocol error occurs while reading a message. Also fixed handling
     of last fragment bit for DICOM command PDV's. Re-organized code to
     use watchpoints more consistently in dicom_network.c

Fri Feb 20 12:29:18 EST 1998
   - Fixed bug in acrnema library (dicom_client_routines) that sometimes
     caused write errors under irix 5.3.

Thu Feb 19 10:05:34 EST 1998
   - Minor bug fixes.

Wed Feb 18 15:29:28 EST 1998
   - Minor bug fixes in libacrnema.

Mon Sep 29 08:24:20 EDT 1997
   - Modified rawtominc so that its argument error messages are more explicit.

Wed Sep 17 09:24:32 EDT 1997
   - Modified gcomserver to do conversions to dicom and retransmit data
     to a dicom server.

************************************************************************

Fri Sep 12 13:24:48 EDT 1997 *** RELEASE OF MINC 0.6

Thu Sep 11 10:54:41 EDT 1997
   - Copied in new version of volume_io. The version released with minc 0.5
     was missing function set_volume_translation. It has been re-instated.

Thu Sep 11 09:46:51 EDT 1997
   - Modified gcomserver to have project file syntax that allows different
     things to be done to the data. The old syntax is still supported.

Wed Sep 10 15:31:27 EDT 1997
   - Small modification to dicomserver (siemens_dicom_read.c) to 
     set default direction cosines properly if they are absent from
     the dicom data.

Mon Sep 08 17:52:21 EDT 1997
   - Added dicom client routines to acr_nema library.
   - Added new status for connection timeout to acr_nema library.

Tue Sep 02 18:52:12 EDT 1997
   - Fixed acr_nema library (element.c) padding of UI-type elements
     (pad with NUL instead of blank).

************************************************************************

Thu Aug 21 09:22:18 EDT 1997 *** RELEASE OF MINC 0.5

Wed Aug 13 19:30:00 EDT 1997
   - Changes to acr-nema library: Fixed bug that was causing the loss of
     PDU items on read in dicom_network.c. Added function 
     acr_group_remove_element to group.c.
Wed Aug 13 12:09:37 EDT 1997
   - Copied in new release of volume_io
Wed Aug 13 11:44:38 EDT 1997
   - Fixed initialization bug in mincresample that caused it to always
     crash under Linux
Tue Aug 12 11:44:38 EDT 1997
   - Added new program mincmakevector for assembling a list of scalar
     files into one vector file.
Thu Aug  7 11:44:38 EDT 1997
   - Added new program mincmakescalar for converting vector volumes
     to scalar by various schemes.
Fri Jun 20 09:59:47 EDT 1997
   - Fixed bug in voxel_loop that affected mincconcat when concatenating
     4D (or greater) files. Basically, when there are no output files
     and accumulation is used, then an outer loop over files is done
     (process each file in order). With 4D or greater input files, the first
     volume of each file would be handled correctly, but subsequent volumes
     would only have the last slice read in.
Tue Jun  3 10:59:29 EDT 1997
   - Really corrected dimension width suffix added by mincconcat. 
     Changed to _width to -width (fix of Aug 27, 1996 was not complete)

************************************************************************

Wed May  7 16:05:05 EDT 1997 *** RELEASE OF MINC 0.4

Wed May  7 15:09:58 EDT 1997
   - Changed distribution script to use gzip instead of compress.
Thu Apr 24 13:48:51 EDT 1997
   - Added mincmath options: -maximum, -minimum, -abs, 
     -illegal_value and -count_valid.
Wed Apr 23 10:58:02 EDT 1997
   - Added code to volume_io/Prog_utils/files.c to handle missing strerror
     (on SunOS). Modified configure.in and Make_machine_specific.in to 
     define constant in this case (through GLOBAL_CDEFINES).
   - Fixed progs install so that directories with more than one binary 
     will get them all installed under linux (bash seems to have a problem
     with my Bourne shell code).
   - Added dependencies for install targets. They were removed at one
     point, but it seems safer to have them in. They'll probably disappear
     at a later point, and perhaps I'll make a note of the reason...!
   - Added options -maximum, -minimum, -abs, -illegal_value and -count_valid
     to mincmath. Fixed handling of invalid or uninitialized data for
     cumulative operations.
Mon Apr 21 13:33:55 EDT 1997
   - Fixed icv calculation of scale so that values are never re-scaled
     from their internal "real" value to an external floating-point type
     (or the other way around). Previously, this re-scaling could occur if
     normalization was turned off and a valid range was set in the file.
Thu Apr 17 14:45:18 EDT 1997
   - Added option of setting BUILD_FORTRAN to "no" for configure.
   - Moved building of volume_io documentations to docs directory.
   - Added explicit path to run_tests script
Thu Apr 10 15:23:32 EDT 1997
   - Fixed icv handling of invalid data when the scale factor is zero. When
     this happens fillvalue checking is turned on (for both input and
     output) regardless of the user setting. This fixes problems when
     mincmath is writing out a uniform image that contains invalid data
     as well.
   - Removed redefinition of NULL from library header file and added
     casts to pointer types in places where it matters.
Mon Mar 10 15:23:32 EDT 1997
   - Updated ACR-NEMA library to handle dicom messages.
Wed Jan 15 11:26:28 EST 1997
   - Fixed small bug in test program minc_types.c so that handling of FLT_MAX
     is done properly and output agrees with original output and
Tue Jan 14 14:47:40 EST 1997
   - Added Fortran wrappers miopn, micre and miclos
Tue Jan  7 14:47:40 EST 1997
   - Added -origin option to rawtominc.
Tue Dec 10 09:30:21 EST 1996
   - Modified top-level Makefile
      - added targets libs, programs, test and docs
      - default make no longer does make in docs directory
Tue Aug 27 13:08:18 EDT 1996
   - Corrected dimension width suffix added by mincconcat. Changed to _width 
     to -width.
Wed Jul 10 13:08:18 EDT 1996
   - Modified minclookup:
      - added output type options
      - added -lut_string
      - added handling of duplicate first or last lookup table entries
      - added man page
Wed Jun 19 14:26:33 EDT 1996
   - Catch errors in opening file specified with -input for rawtominc
Tue Jan 16 08:30:08 EST 1996
   - Added -invert option to mincmath
Wed Dec 13 08:47:26 EST 1995
   - Added -check_dimensions and -nocheck_dimensions options to mincmath.
   - Improved tmp dir cleanup in mincview when an error occurs.
   - Small changes to minc_modify_header man page.
Tue Dec 12 14:19:07 EST 1995
   - Added convert_origin_to_start routines to Proglib to handle conversion
     of a point to a start value given 3 direction cosines
   - Modified mincresample:
      - modified argument parsing so that only one pass is done
      - changed default to transform input sampling when -transformation
        is specified and added options -tfm_input_sampling (to get above 
        behaviour) and -use_input_sampling (to get old behaviour).
      - added -origin option to specify a coordinate instead of dimension
        start values.
      - added -standard_sampling option.
      - added -invert_transformation option.
      - added -spacetype, -talairach and -units options.
Mon Nov 20 14:24:47 EST 1995
   - Added -weights option to mincaverage.
Thu Nov 16 13:11:16 EST 1995
   - Include math.h in rawtominc, mincwindow, mincinfo, mincconcat 
     and Acr_nema library to get declaration of strtod under SunOs.
Wed Oct  4 19:05:25 EDT 1995
   - Fixed default minimum for signed long.
Fri Sep 29 12:59:06 EDT 1995
   - Modified micopy_all_atts in library to handle MI_ERROR being passed
     as a variable id.
   - Fixed handling of image-min/max in mincconcat when the variables are
     not present in the input files.
Wed Aug  2 13:41:36
   - Added -prefix option to gyrotominc.
Fri Jun 16 08:28:39 EDT 1995
   - Modified mincview so that file name appears in xv window frame.
Tue Jun 13 16:44:28 EDT 1995
   - Improved test for ANSI compiler in configure script. Check that
     (signed char *) is handled properly (since the Solaris compiler
     doesn't handle it from what I've been told).
   - Improved configuration for fortran compilation. Set FORTRAN_SUBDIR
     and FORTRAN_OBJ from configure only if f77 is found and the system
     is irix.
Mon Jun 12 13:32:53 EDT 1995
   - Added MI_LABEL modality to minc.h
   - Modified miexpand_file and miopen to try adding compression
     extensions to filenames if the first open fails.
