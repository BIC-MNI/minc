	* file_io.c: Include "config.h" for access to symbols HAVE_MKSTEMP
	and HAVE_TMPNAM.  Ensure that only one or the other is used and
	add #error directives for the case that neither is
	defined. Conditionalize definitions of Input_trace_file and
	Output_trace_file to avoid compiler warning.

2006-09-01  Jonathan Harlap <jharlap@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Fix bug in element.c: modified maybe_print_as_string to only skip element
	0x7fe0,0x0010 rather than all elements with element number 0x0010

2005-05-09  Robert Vincent  <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Add and update dicom.txt, a list of DICOM field names.
	* Fix bug in group.c so that acr_find_short, acr_find_int,
	acr_find_long, and acr_find_double will return the default
	value if the element is present but contains no data.
	
2005-03-11  Robert Vincent  <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* dump_acr_nema.c: add '-t' option to parse files which contain
	lists of field names with corresponding group and element id's.
	* group.c, element.c, acr_nema/group.h - define _acr_name_proc as
	a global that defines the naming procedure to use to determine the
	symbolic name of a group/element pair.

	* ChangeLog: Latest changes

	* group.c:
	Change several functions to return Acr_Status instead of void; lose public and private; Make insert_element() check the return value of acr_get_element_total_length()

	* element.c:
	Avoid memory leak by freeing unused elements in a sequence.  Fix order of initialization in acr_create_element() to set variable length property correctly. Don't change VR encoding when parsing a sequence, rely on the new handling of 0xfffe group items by the acr_io functions

	* acr_io.c:
	Lose public and private keywords; change acr_read_one_element to assume implicit VR format for special sequence delimiters (group 0xfffe)

	* file_io.c, value_repr.c: Lose private and public

	* acr_nema/acr_io.h, acr_nema/element.h, acr_nema/file_io.h, acr_nema/group.h, acr_nema/value_repr.h:
	Cleanup headers, mostly by getting rid of the infernal 'public' and using extern instead

	* Makefile.am:
	Move most of the headers into an acr_nema subdirectory to avoid naming conflicts

2005-03-03 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Modify sequence handling to better conform to the DICOM
	specification.  This means handling group 0xfffe items as
	magically conforming to implicit VR format. See DICOM Part 5,
	section 7.5 for more details.	
	* Fix bug that prevented any data element from ever being tagged
	as "variable length".  This bug prevented us from properly parsing
	files with sequences with unspecified lengths.
	* Modify acr_get_element_total_length() to return zero if the
	vr_name is NULL.  This avoids a core dump when erroneously parsing
	non-DICOM files.
	* Also got rid of small memory leak in sequence reading.
	* Other random tweaks and cleanup.
	
2005-02-16 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Autoconfiscation
	* Move headers into acr_nema subdirectory to avoid naming
	conflicts
	* Get rid of mktemp() warnings by using mkstemp().
