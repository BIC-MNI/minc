See INSTALL for generic installation instructions.

Shared or Static libraries?
---------------------------
By default, only a static version (i.e. libminc.a) will be produced.
A shared version of the library may be enabled using the configure
flag "--enabled-shared".  See also "--disable-static".


Finding NetCDF/HDF5
-------------------
The NetCDF and HDF libraries must be built and installed before you 
can build MINC. Teaching MINC to find the NetCDF library depends on where
the latter is installed.  There are two possibilities here:

1. NetCDF and HDF5 may be installed in a location where the compiler can find
it.  If so, you have nothing to do.

2. Third-party libraries are commonly installed with headers
in /usr/local/include and libraries in /usr/local/include.
If this is the case, you should pass the argument
"--with-build-path=/usr/local" to configure as such:

   ./configure --with-build-path=/usr/local <options>


Compiling
---------
Now that things are configured all you need to do is run:

  make

and then

  make install


Building against the MINC2 library
----------------------------------
From here on in if you wish to build against the MINC2 library with
other packages you will have to use the --with-minc2 configure flag
