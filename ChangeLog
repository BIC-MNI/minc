     which the ordering of the slices in the MOSAIC image is ascending,
     even though the acquisition is descending (version >= VA25 and
     >= VB11).

      proper operation with MINC 2.0

2006-04-19 Claude Lepage <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * fix duplicate instances of solve_linear_system and 
      scaled_maximal_pivoting_gaussian_elimination in
      volume_io/Geometry/gaussian.c and libsrc.2. Make static.
      This is to avoid linker problems with minc2.

2006-04-09 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * conversion/dcm2mnc, conversion/Acr_nema - added general support
   for Siemens DTI sequences, inserting attributes according to
   Jennifer Campbell's conventions.

2006-03-27 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * conversion/nifti1/mnc2nii.c - Set time and vector dimensions 
   "properly" for some versions of Analyze and NIfTI libraries. Also
   set the intent_code field to NIFTI_INTENT_VECTOR if the 
   vector_dimension is set. Also fixed an issue with file names.

2006-03-10 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * conversion/Acr_nema/element.c - Modify acr_dump_element_list()
   to use helper function maybe_print_as_string() to print data with
   unknown VR as either ASCII or a string of hex bytes.

        types for labels.

2005-12-15 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * libsrc2/volume.c - set units field unconditionally in 
   _miget_file_dimension()

2005-12-13 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * conversion/dcm2mnc/dicom_to_minc.c: Ignore DICOM protocol
      errors. This change was necessitated by images from a Philips
      Intera scanner version 'NT 10.4.1\\PIIM V2.1.4.1 MIMIT MCS' that
      appears to set the DICOM length field incorrectly.

2005-12-03 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * conversion/micropet/upet2mnc.c - fix handling of single-frame data
   * progs/mincgen/main.c - make "-o" option imply "-b"

   * conversion/dcm2mnc/dcm2mnc.c - fix test for is_ima_file()

2005-11-04 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * conversion/dcm2mnc/dicom_to_minc.h - further relaxation of 
      COORDINATE_EPSILON, now set to 0.005
   * conversion/dcm2mnc/minc_file.c - combine cloned
      regular/irregular dimension checking code into new function,
      check_regular()
   * conversion/dcm2mnc/dcm2mnc.c - update version to 2.0.07

2005-10-26 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * conversion/dcm2mnc/dicom_to_minc.h - set COORDINATE_EPSILON to
      a fixed value of 0.0001 rather than 100*FLT_EPSILON to allow for
      more slop in coordinates.
   * conversion/nifti1/mnc2nii.c - handle missing value for spacetype.
   
2005-09-16 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * libsrc2/conversion/dcm2mnc/dicom_read.c - again change the
   handling of the slice thickness / slice spacing issue to
   accomodate Andrew Janke's Philips data. If both slice thickness
   and slice spacing are set, we select the maximum. For some reason
   I had been choosing the minimum, but logically the opposite seems
   more reasonable (and is certainly correct in Andrew's case).
   
2005-09-14 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * libsrc2/slice.c - in function mirw_slice_minmax(), properly 
   reorient access for slice minimum and maximum if dimension 
   order has been altered.
   * libsrc2/hyper.c - normalize data correctly in 
   miget_real_value_hyperslab().
   * progs/mincinfo/mincinfo.c - include config.h
   
2005-08-26 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Implemented --enable-hdf5 option in ./configure
   script so that we can selectively enable or disable MINC2 support.
   This required changing the way we treat the MINC2 symbol, and
   being careful to include config.h in all files that call netCDF 
   functions.
   * libsrc2/grpattr.c - Fixed issue in micreate_group() function -
   it would not function properly when a group already existed in the 
   file.
   * conversion/dcm2mnc - Ported changes from MINC 1 branch.
   
2005-07-29  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * progs/mincstats/mincstats.c: Add warning when mask file
   specified with no mask range option.
   
2005-07-28  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * conversion/nifti1/mnc2nii.c: Implement fix suggested by
   Hyun-Pil Kim to set unused dimension lengths to 1 rather than
   zero.
   
2005-07-25  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * progs/mincstats/mincstats.c: Fix calculation of percent
   threshold to correctly account for non-zero histogram floor.

2005-07-15 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   
   * libsrc/hdf_convenience.c: Two minor fixes.  First, when
   emulating 'signtype' attributes in MINC 2 files, comparisons
   with MI_SIGNED and MI_UNSIGNED should NOT depend on a properly-
   null-terminated  attribute value.  Second, suppress HDF5 errors 
   in hdf_attdel()
   
   * progs/mincresample/mincresample.c
   * progs/mincresample/mincresample.h
   * progs/mincresample/mincresample.man1
   * progs/mincresample/resample_volumes.c
   Support windowed sinc interpolation, as ported from 1.X branch.
   
   * progs/mincconcat/mincconcat.c:
   * progs/mincconcat/mincconcat.man1:
   Add support for -filestarts option, as ported from 1.X branch.
   
2005-07-04  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

   * Makefile.am:
   * progs/minchistory/minchistory.man1: New manual page for
   minchistory.

2005-07-03  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>

   * configure.in: Check for sysconf().

   POSIX sysconf() function, if available.

2005-06-22  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Minor fix to ncgenyy.l to avoid compiler complaint on ia64.
   
2005-05-20  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   
   * Update Makefile.msvc-win32 to build converters.
   
   * Declare restructure_array() in hyper.c to be MNCAPI so that
   nii2mnc can link to it.
   
   * Get rid of warnings in mincgen build.  Affected files are 
   progs/mincgen/ncgenyy.l and progs/mincgen/ncgentab.y
   
   * Replace direct usage of H5Fis_hdf5() function to avoid annoying
   error messages for nonexistant files.  Instead there is now a 
   function named hdf_access() that returns a boolean value TRUE if
   the file can be accessed and is in HDF5 format.  This change
   affected the files libsrc/hdf_convenience.h,
   libsrc/hdf_convenience.c, and libsrc/netcdf_convenience.c

   * Remove and/or conditionalize some test code for memory-mapped
   files that should not have been checked in.  Affected files are
   libsrc/netcdf_convenience.c, libsrc/hdf_convenience.c, and 
   progs/mincstats/mincstats.c

   data file, to avoid having to carry around a multi-megabyte test
   file as part of the distrbution.
   
2005-01-19 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Incorporate Anthonin Reilhac's changes to ecattominc

     strings if all of the characters are printable.
   
2005-01-04 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Adapt minc_simple.c to use Leila's revision of the 
   restructure_array() parameters.  This seems to work properly again.
   
2004-12-14 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
     * Got rid of lots of C99-related warnings
     * Added new biModalT algorithms to mincstats

2004-12-15 Andrew Janke <a.janke@gmail.com>
    * added epm-header.in, removed mni_minc.epm.header

2004-12-07 Andrew Janke <a.janke@gmail.com>
    * Squashed yet another bug with the BiModalT code
       aaargh!  This should now replicate volume_stats even closer!

2004-10-18 Andrew Janke <a.janke@gmail.com>
   * Fixed bug in mincstats -BimodalT code to
           exactly replicate (within reason) volume_stats
   * Changed default # of int histogram bins from 10000 to 65536

2004-08-11 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

   * Fix bug(s) in volume.c
   * Correctly implement some of the conversion functions
   
2004-06-21 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Updated mincgen man page
   * "Improve" Doxygen documentation 
   
2004-06-16 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>   
   * Fixes and improvements for mincgen/mincdump
   * Emulate a vector_dimension for MINC 2.0 files with a compound
   datatype.
   * Move libsrc2 (MINC 2.0 API) files under the MINC hierarchy in CVS
   * Fix ordering of world coordinate values in miconvert_world_to_voxel
   and miconvert_voxel_to_world
   
2004-06-11 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Fix issue with minc_modify_header's new -sappend and -dappend
   options.
   * Add "mincgen" based upon "ncgen" for "mincedit"
   * Fix nasty minccalc bug.  Minccalc would fail to work properly 
   on any file with a vector_dimension of length greater than 1.
   
2004-06-09 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Add netcdf and HDF5 versions to the -version list.
   
2004-06-08 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Avoid printing HDF5 errors on excessively long attributes.  Still
   have to decide how best to deal with this situations - truncate, 
   drop, or somehow convert the attribute into a dataset?  Right now
   we will drop excessively large attributes from HDF5 files, which is
   probably bad.
   * Fix bug (mentioned in previous entries) which caused mincdump
   (as derived from ncdump) to print zero-length attributes as an 
   erroneous string of length one instead of as an empty string.
   * Eliminate bogus "not implemented yet" message from volume_io
   
2004-06-07 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Fix setting of length in hdf_vardef/hdf_dimdef
   * Handle zero-length character strings properly.  There is actually
   a minor bug in "ncdump" which makes zero-length strings appear to
   have length one (the bogus character will appear to match the first 
   character in the preceding string).
   
2004-06-04 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Changed volume_io/Volumes/volume_cache.c to increase both the
   cache size and the default cached volume size (i.e. the size which
   turns on caching).
   
2004-06-01 Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Fixed endian-ness issues in MINC 2.0 format.

   * Fix dimorder handling

2004-02-18  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca> 
   
   * Fixed handling of "rootvariable" emulation in hdf_convenience.c
   and netcdf_convenience.c
   
   * Fixed behavior of some of the netCDF emulation attribute functions
   in hdf_convenience.c and minc_compat.c
   
2004-02-17  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   
   * Fixed mincconvert - added ncendef()
   
   * Actually implemented MINC_COMPRESS

MINC 1:

   * Minor fix to miappend_history() in libsrc/minc_convenience.c
   
2004-03-23  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Modify configure.in, libsrc/netcdf_convenience.c, 
   volume_io/Prog_utils/files.c, and volume_io/Prog_utils/time.c to 
   make MINC more portable, especially to Windows compilers.
   
2003-02-02  Bert Vincent <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Added -version flag for all executables (or at least all "C" 
   language executables).  Implemented in ParseArgv() to make it
   universal, and applications can override their version number by
   adding a "ARGV_VERINFO" record to their argTable[].

   * Created miget_version() and miappend_history() functions.
   
2003-12-05  Andrew L. Janke <a.janke@gmail.com>

    * Changes to mincpik: added -depth option (as per a diff supplied
    by Jonathan HARLAP); while at it, did a bit of clean-up including
    replacing home-grown tempdir cleanup with File::Temp; Added -clobber
    option so that mincpik more closely matches the other minc tools.

2003-11-23  Steve M. Robbins  <steve@nyongwa.montreal.qc.ca>
