.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mincdiff
.BI [-header|-body]

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fImincdiff\fR shell script compares two minc files by running
\fBdiff(1)\fR on the headers of the two minc files, and \fBcmp(1)\fR
on the image variable.  You can view only the header differences using
\fB\-header\fR or only the body (image variable) differences using
\fB\-body\fR.  The option \fB\-l\fR is passed on to \fBcmp\fR of the
image variable.  Any unrecognized options (e.g. -u) are passed
verbatim to the \fBdiff\fR of the headers.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-header\fR Compare only the headers of the two files.
.TP
\fB\-body\fR Compare only the image data of the two files.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR Print the byte offset in decimal and the byte value in octal
for each difference encountered in the image variable.
