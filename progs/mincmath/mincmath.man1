.SH NAME
mincmath - perform simple math operations on minc files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mincmath
[<options>] <in1>.mnc [<in2>.mnc...] <out>.mnc

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIMincmath\fR will perform simple, voxel-by-voxel math operations, 
on one or more minc files of the same shape and having the same 
coordinate sampling, producing a single output file. Operations can be
unary (operate on one file), binary (two input files) or cumulative 
(operate on two or more input files). Cumulative operations can also 
be performed across a specified dimension of the input files.

.SH OPTIONS
Note that options can be specified in abbreviated form (as long as
they are unique) and can be given anywhere on the command line.

.SH General options
.TP
\fB\-2\fR
Create a MINC 2.0 format output file.
.TP
\fB\-clobber\fR
Overwrite an existing file.
.TP
\fB\-noclobber\fR
Don't overwrite an existing file (default).
.TP
\fB\-no_clobber\fR
Synonym for \fB\-noclobber\fR.
.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR
Print out progress information for each chunk of data copied (default).
.TP

Do not print out progress information.
.TP
\fB\-debug\fR
Print out debugging information.
.TP
\fB\-filelist\fR\ \fIfilename\fR
Specify a file containing a list of input file names. If "-" is given, then
file names are read from the standard input. If this option is given, then 
there should be no input file names specified on the command line. Empty
lines in the input file are ignored.
.TP
\fB\-copy_header\fR
Copy all of the header information from the first input file (default for 
one input file).
.TP
\fB\-nocopy_header\fR
Do not copy all of the header from the first input file; copy only
coordinate information (default for more than one input file).
.TP
\fB\-filetype\fR
Create an output file with the same type as the first input file
(default).
.TP
\fB\-byte\fR
Store output voxels in 8-bit integer format.
.TP
\fB\-short\fR
Store output voxels in 16-bit integer format.
.TP
\fB-int\fR

.TP
\fB-long\fR
Superseded by \fB\-int\fR.
.TP
\fB-float\fR

.TP
\fB-double\fR
Store output voxels in 64-bit floating point format.
.TP
\fB\-signed\fR
Use signed, two's complement integer format. Applies only
if the output voxel type is specified to be an integer type
(one of \fB\-byte\fR, \fB\-short\fR, \fB\-int\fR or \fB-long\fR).
.TP
\fB\-unsigned\fR
Use unsigned integer format. Applies only
if the output voxel type is specified to be an integer type
(one of \fB\-byte\fR, \fB\-short\fR, \fB\-int\fR or \fB-long\fR).
.TP
\fB\-range\fR \fImin max\fR
Restrict the valid range of integer data.  Applies only if one
of the \fB-byte\fR, \fB-short\fR, \fB-int\fR or \fB\-long\fR options is
specified.
.TP
\fB\-max_buffer_size_in_kb\fR \fIsize\fR
Specify the maximum size of the internal buffers (in kbytes). Default
is 4096 (4MB).
.TP
\fB\-dimension\fR\ \fIdimname\fR
Specify a dimension along which we wish to perform a cumulative
operation.
.TP
\fB\-check_dimensions\fR
Check that all input files have matching sampling in world 
dimensions (default).
.TP
\fB\-nocheck_dimensions\fR
Ignore any differences in world dimensions sampling for input files .
.TP
\fB\-propagate_nan\fR
Invalid data (Not-A-Number or NaN) at a voxel in any of the input
files will produce invalid data in the output file at that voxel
(default).
.TP
\fB\-ignore_nan\fR
For cumulative operations, invalid data (NaN) in an input file is
ignored, ie. treated as though it is not present.
.TP
\fB\-nan\fR
When an illegal operation is attempted at a voxel (such as divide by
zero), invalid data (NaN) is stored in the output file (default). Having 
no valid input data for a cumulative operation is also considered an 
illegal operation when \fB\-ignore_nan\fR is used.
.TP
\fB\-zero\fR
When an illegal operation is attempted at a voxel (such as divide by
zero), value zero is stored in the output file.
.TP
\fB\-illegal_value\fR\ \fIvalue\fR
When an illegal operation is attempted at a voxel (such as divide by
zero), the specified value is stored in the output file.

.SH Options for specifying constants
